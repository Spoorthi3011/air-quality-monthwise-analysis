**Air Quality Analysis with Machine Learning**


**Overview**
This project performs comprehensive air quality analysis using machine learning techniques such as K-Means clustering, Random Forest regression, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It utilizes the "PRSA_Data_Nongzhanguan" dataset to assess air quality data for various pollutants, including PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3.


**Data Preprocessing**

Data is loaded from a CSV file and selected columns relevant to the analysis.
Missing data is removed.
Data is grouped by month, and an air quality score is calculated for each month based on pollutant concentrations.


**K-Means Clustering**

K-Means clustering is applied to categorize the months into clusters based on their air quality scores.
The month with the best air quality is identified within the cluster with the highest average score.


**Random Forest Regression**

A Random Forest regression model is trained to predict PM2.5 levels based on temperature (TEMP), pressure (PRES), dew point temperature (DEWP), and wind speed (WSPM).
Model performance is evaluated.


**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**

A CNN model is built to predict PM2.5 levels.
The model architecture includes convolutional layers, max-pooling, and dense layers.
Model performance is evaluated.


**Results**

The project provides insights into air quality trends and identifies the month with the best air quality.
Random Forest and CNN models are used for air quality prediction.
Model accuracies are reported.
**Usage**
Install the required Python libraries listed in the code.
Download the "PRSA_Data_Nongzhanguan" dataset and specify the file path.
Run the code to perform air quality analysis and prediction.
